				<h2>Get To Know Me...</h2>

					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will be able to take a look at all of the projects, lessons, and reflections that I have learned throughout the entire <strong>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program!</strong> I was born on September 29 in the city of <strong>Inglewood, California</strong>; in my entire life I have lived in the same city and the same house. I am a Salvadorean-American, my mom and dad were both born in El Salvadorean, in which they later Immigrated to the U.S, where they met and had me! I am currently a<strong> Senior at Da Vinci Communications High School</strong>.
							 I have many different likes and dislikes, let me start off by telling you what I like and my favorites. <strong>I really like music,</strong> my favorite artist (at the moment) are: Selena Gomez, Shawn Mendes, Marc E. Bassy, and Drake.<strong> My favorite movies </strong> are: All Spider-Man Movies (even remakes), all SAW movies, and all Paranormal Activity movies. <strong>My favorite tv-shows </strong> are: Riverdale, The Flash, The Originals, That 70’s Show, and Bob’s Burgers. Lastly, my favorite websites to visit are: Forever 21, H&M, Sephora, and Lime Crime!
							Now, here are a couple of things that I dislike and hate (a strong word, I know.) <strong> I hate heights </strong>, they terrify the living life out of me, which also connects to my fear of flying in an airplane. Lastly, I truly dislike people <strong> who are rude </strong> to other people who are trying to help them out or doing them a favor.
								Lastly, here’s a fun fact; I come from a very big family, on my mom side of the family I have about 8 cousins and from my dad side of the family I have about 11 cousins; all together I have about 19 cousins! </p>

										<p>	In this project, my partner and I had to go through the design process of creating our own side scrolling game on Scratch, that had to connect to something we both liked and cared about.  The first thing that we did was to identify the Minimum Viable Product for our game, and figuring out what features and story line that we wanted to do. The second step was to create a storyboard of our game, explaining the beginning, middle, and end of our game. The third step was to  figured out what artwork we wanted and characters we wanted. We ended choosing the character Tom and Jerry, the objective of the game was that Jerry needed to avoid all of the obstacles that were coming his way, such as: Tom, cactus, bushes, and much more! Once, we had all our designing features, we began coding our game!</p>

										<p>We were recently given an assignment, where each student needed to explain what the Core 4 values were. Girls Who Code, created the concept of the Core 4, because these concepts can be combined to solve many kinds of problems, such as when a person is building a game, creating artwork, and etc; the Core 4 consist of: variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Our task was to look up the technical definitions of each word, a piece of code on python and scratch, and creating an analogy to describe these words. You can take a look at the examples that I created by clicking on the button that states “Google Docs”, this button will take you to the google doc that I created, describing the Core 4. </p>

								Challenge 0: 
										 In challenge 0, all we needed to do was to light up the circuit. Brittney (my partner) and I took the challenge lightly and began finding out different ways the circuit would and would not work. The images of the LED Lights off are the circuits done incorrectly, the reason is because both the white and gray wires are on the negative side, when the white wire is suppose to be on the positive side. Then, we are also able to see how the ground(grey wire) does not line up with the resistor, whish is making the circuit incomplete and causing no enegry to travel through to the light. Then, in both images the LED is not facing the correct way, it should have been flipped around so that the light would be receving energy, so the LED would light up. The image of the LED lights on are the circuits done correctly, the reason is that the white wire is connects to the positive side which in the raspberry pi, its on the 3.3 V power and the gray wire is connected on the negative side on the same row as the resistor. As you can see in the image with the light buld on, has the circuit that is fully complete with the ground wire being correctly connected to the resistor, which is connected to the light buld on the negative side and the power connected to the positive side. In the photos of the LED on has all the right cables, both the resistor and the lightbulds are in the correct place, therefore causing the LED circuit to work.

								Challenge 1: Once, we knew how to connect the circuits correctly to get the LED lights on, we began coding using the language of python. Brittney and I, primarily began doing research on how we could change the pattern of the lights, in which we did. Once, we found out how to do it, we began coding in which we simply delayed the timing for  on and off button by five seconds and had it repeat twice before it turned off.The way we did this was by using "import time", so that when we code "time.sleep()" it will control the flow of our code; using this would allow us to tell the raspberry pi when to turn off and on the LED lights when inputting a time. Then we began setting up the GPIO pins to the corresponding slot, so that it could be used for an input or output. We have to let the RPI know we will be using the GPIO pin 18 as an output (as you can see if you press the Python button on the toolbard.)Then in our code you will see that we have "GPIO.output(18.GPIO.High)", the reason why it is in parenthesis is, because we are selecting the pin number 18 and turning it on writing in High and then when we want the pin to turn off, we would write in "low". Then doing that we inputted "time.sleep(5)", letting the Raspberry pi that we want the light to go off for five seconds, before turning it off. Lastly, at the end of the code it states, "GPIO.cleanup()" basically just end the program and helps avoid causing an damage to our RPI by shorting out the pins.

									Challenge 2: We were given the task of programming a circuit that receives input from the user and is able to produce a visible output in the circuit. What Brittney and I did was to code a script that detects user input and flashes morse code on the lights. The code is able to detect when the user types in capital letters, puntuations, and any special character that the user decides to write in. Brittney and I made our light show say "Hewwoooooo" (an Inside Joke). So, the way this would work is that the user would head towards the terminal, once they are at the terminal; they would be able to write down any thing and once they word down their desired word, they would press enter and the lights will flash out the morse code. If you wanna take a look at the code, feel free to press the Python button; it will show you morse code file that contains more than 900 lines.
